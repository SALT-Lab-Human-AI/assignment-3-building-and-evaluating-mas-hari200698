## Overview

User-Centered Design (UCD) is a design philosophy that places users at the center of the design process. Originating from Donald Norman's work at UCSD in the 1980s, UCD has become a foundational approach in Human-Computer Interaction [Source: Norman & Draper, 1986].

## Core Principles

### 1. Early Focus on Users
The design process should begin with understanding user needs, goals, and contexts of use. This involves direct contact with users through interviews, observations, and surveys [Source: Abras et al., 2004].

### 2. Iterative Design
Design solutions are developed through cycles of prototyping, testing, and refinement. Each iteration incorporates user feedback to improve the design [Source: Vredenburg et al., 2002].

### 3. Empirical Measurement
User behavior and satisfaction are measured through usability testing with real users, not just expert evaluations [Source: Nielsen Norman Group].

### 4. Integrated Design
All aspects of usability (interface, documentation, support) are developed together, not as afterthoughts.
